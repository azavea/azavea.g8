# $name$
An API project that uses `tapir`, `http4s`, and `doobie`

### Development

The following tools must be present for a development environment:
 - Docker
 - Java 8 or newer -- if this is a problem, try using [`jabba`](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba#jabba--) to manage different java versions
 - Sbt 1.x -- the newer the better probably, installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
 - [Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/) -- this is a scala build server that should run in the background for building the project; installation instructions can be found [here](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/setup)

### STRTA

This project uses [`scripts-to-rule-them-all`](https://github.blog/2015-06-30-scripts-to-rule-them-all/) for managing the developer experience. Below is a quick explanation for the specific usage of each for this particular project.

| Script | Use |
|---|---|
| `setup` | Used to provision the project from scratch |
| `update` | Update project, assemble, run migrations; assume that you can test any PR after running this script on that PR's branch |
| `console` | Open an `ammonite` shell |
| `server` | Start the server |
| `dbshell` | Open a `psql` shell connected to the database |
| `migrate` | Run migrations against the database |
| `tests` | Run tests |
| `cibuild` | Assemble jars and create containers |
